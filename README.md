**Develop a modern rendering engine from first principles to state-of-the-art techniques**

## What is this book about?
Vulkan is now an established and flexible multi-platform graphics API. It has been adopted in many industries, including game development, medical imaging, movie productions, and media playback. Learning Vulkan is a foundational step to understanding how a modern graphics API works, both on desktop and mobile.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand resources management and modern bindless techniques
* Get comfortable with how a frame graph works and know its  advantages
* Explore how to render efficiently with many light sources
* Discover how to integrate variable rate shading
* Understand the benefits and limitations of temporal anti-aliasing
* Get to grips with how GPU-driven rendering works
* Explore and leverage ray tracing to improve render quality

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
export VULKAN_SDK=~/vulkan/1.2.198.1/x86_64
export PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export VK_LAYER_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/explicit_layer.d
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for professional graphics and game developers who want to gain in-depth knowledge about how to write a modern and performant rendering engine in Vulkan. Familiarity with basic concepts of graphics programming (i.e. matrices, vectors, etc.) and fundamental knowledge of Vulkan are required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).

## Get to Know the Authors
**Marco Castorina** first got familiar with Vulkan while working as a driver developer at Samsung. Later he developed a 2D and 3D renderer in Vulkan from scratch for a leading media-server company. He recently joined the games graphics performance team at AMD. In his spare time, he keeps up to date with the latest techniques in real-time graphics.

**Gabriel Sassone** is a rendering enthusiast currently working as a Principal Rendering Engineer at Multiplayer Group. Previously working for Avalanche Studios, where his first contact with Vulkan happened, where they developed the Vulkan layer for the proprietary Apex Engine and its Google Stadia Port. He previously worked at ReadyAtDawn, Codemasters, FrameStudios, and some non-gaming tech companies. His spare time is filled with music and rendering, gaming, and outdoor activities.
